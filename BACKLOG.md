## Photo-to-Rate Flow

**Summary:** Let users photograph their food, match it to a dish, and rate it later.

**Flow:**
1. User takes photo of their food
2. AI + location tries to match to existing dish in database
3. If match found → save to "rate later" queue
4. If no match → user can add the dish (photo already attached)
5. Reminder when user opens app: "You have dishes to rate!"

**Why it's good:**
- Users already love photographing food - capture that moment
- Reduces friction (no searching while eating)
- Crowdsources database growth when dishes aren't found
- Gets user-submitted photos for dish cards

**Technical needs:**
- OpenAI Vision API or Google Cloud Vision for photo analysis
- Supabase Storage for photos
- New `pending_ratings` table
- Reminder system (in-app first, push notifications later)

**Suggested approach:**
- v1: Skip AI matching. Photo → pick restaurant → pick or add dish → rate later
- v2: Add AI matching once dish database is larger

## Pre-Launch Data Seeding

**Goal:** Have enough real data that new users see value immediately.

**Approach:** Founders rate 50+ dishes before public launch. These are real ratings, not fake seeds.

**Why this works:**
- 100% authentic data
- No "disappearing ratings" confusion
- Founders ARE users — this is dogfooding
- No trust erosion later

**Targets before launch:**
- 50+ dish ratings across 10+ restaurants
- Cover major categories (pizza, seafood, breakfast, etc.)
- Hit the popular spots tourists will search for

**Soft launch option:**
- Invite 20 friends for 2 weeks before public launch
- Get to 100+ ratings before marketing push

## Gamification Framework

**Golden Rule:** If a mechanic risks inflating scores, biasing ratings, or low-effort behavior — it does not ship.

**NOT building:** Streaks, leaderboards, XP/points, Yelp Elite nonsense

**Phase 1 (Now):**
- Impact feedback after rating ("This dish entered Top 10", "You moved this up 2 spots")
- Contribution count on profile
- "You helped shape this" messaging

**Phase 2 (After traction):**
- Contribution levels: Explorer → Contributor → Tastemaker → Local Legend
- Trust-based unlocks (suggest dishes, flag data, curate lists)

**Phase 3 (Restaurants involved):**
- Specials voting
- Community favorite badges (earned, not paid)
