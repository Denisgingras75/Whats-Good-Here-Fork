# WHAT'S GOOD HERE: BRUTAL HONEST AUDIT + ROADMAP TO 80/100

## CURRENT RATING: 62/100

---

## BREAKDOWN BY CATEGORY

### 1. PROBLEM/SOLUTION FIT: 75/100

**The problem is REAL:**

- ✅ Guests ARE flying blind when choosing dishes
- ✅ Google reviews are gamed/old/irrelevant for specific dishes
- ✅ Yelp photos don't tell you "is this actually good?"
- ✅ "Would you order again?" is genuinely better signal than 5 stars

**But there's friction:**

- ❌ Low intent to solve it: When I'm hungry, I want food NOW, not data validation
- ❌ Habit is entrenched: People default to Google Maps → Photos → Friends' reviews (automatic)
- ❌ Willingness to engage is questionable: Users will vote IF they're already in the app, but getting them there is the hard part
- ❌ Only works post-meal: You can't use this before choosing a restaurant (it's retrospective feedback, not decision-making tool)

**The core issue:** You're solving a real problem, but it's not a "pain point" — it's more of a "nice to have." People don't wake up frustrated that they don't have dish-level data.

**Verdict: 75/100** — Strong enough that people will use it if you get them there, but weak enough that they won't seek it out.

### 2. MARKET SIZE & TIMING: 55/100

**Market size:**

| Segment | Size | Problem |
|---------|------|---------|
| Martha's Vineyard seasonal population | ~50k visitors | Tiny but dense |
| Martha's Vineyard year-round | ~15k | Even smaller |
| All US island destinations (similar model) | ~2-5M annually | Niche |
| Eventual mainland expansion | Unlimited | But that's 3-5 years away |

**Right now:** ~$0-100k TAM annually (MV alone)
**Future (if expanded to 50 cities):** ~$50-200M TAM (possible)

**Timing issues:**

✅ **Good timing factors:**
- QR code menus are NOW standard (post-COVID)
- Restaurants are data-hungry (proven by reservation systems like Resy)
- Gen Z/millennials trust peers more than brands

❌ **Bad timing factors:**
- Food discovery is already solved (Google + TikTok are winning)
- AI is about to make personalized recommendations better (ChatGPT knows your taste)
- You're fighting massive incumbents with zero leverage
- Post-pandemic, restaurants are struggling with basics — they don't care about analytics yet

**Verdict: 55/100** — Market exists, but it's small right now. Timing isn't obviously wrong, but it's not obviously right either. You're betting on restaurants wanting your data eventually — that's speculative.

### 3. DIFFERENTIATION: 72/100

**What you have:**

✅ **Yes/No voting is genuinely better than 5 stars**
- Faster to collect
- Cleaner signal
- Better for restaurants (binary is easier to act on)

✅ **Post-meal capture is superior timing**
- Fresher emotion than day-3 review
- Higher accuracy (they just tasted it)
- Removes trolling incentive (you were just there)

✅ **Hyper-local moat is real**
- You can own Martha's Vineyard before anyone else notices
- High concentration = network effects kick in fast
- Google/Yelp don't optimize for "best restaurant on one island"

✅ **Restaurant partnership angle is novel**
- B2B2C is harder to compete with than pure B2C
- Once restaurants integrate, switching cost is high
- Yelp doesn't have this (restaurants hate Yelp)

❌ **But the defensibility cracks:**
- TikTok already shows "real people eating food" authentically
- Instagram/Reels > structured voting for food discovery
- Google is adding "recent reviews with photos" (closing your gap)
- Yelp could copy this in weeks (they won't, but they could)
- Any restaurant with half a brain will just ask customers directly (via text survey, etc.)

**The real threat:** Someone bigger notices the restaurant B2B2C angle and moves faster. (Example: Toast, Square, or Resy could add "guest voting" in 6 months and kill you because they already own the restaurant relationship.)

**Verdict: 72/100** — Strong differentiation TODAY, but it's defensible for ~2-3 years, not forever. You have a window. Use it.

### 4. EXECUTION PATH: 58/100

**What you've done right:**
- ✅ Product is solid — Clean UI, works, makes sense
- ✅ Core loop is proven — Guests vote, you collect data, works
- ✅ You picked the right starting market — Small, dense, controllable
- ✅ You have a coherent B2B story — Restaurants will eventually care

**Execution risks (this is where it gets brutal):**

❌ **Cold start chicken-and-egg is REAL**
- Guests won't use it without data volume
- Restaurants won't care without guest volume
- You need both to start → how do you bootstrap?
- Your current answer: "MV has many restaurants" — but do they have guests who'll vote?

❌ **Restaurant integration is harder than it looks**
- You need to convince 50+ restaurants to print your QR code
- You need their staff to want to ask guests to scan
- Staff don't benefit (no commission, no incentive)
- One bad integration ruins the whole island
- You need sales + customer success = capital intensive

❌ **Geographic expansion is painful**
- "Works on MV" ≠ "Works everywhere"
- Every new island needs: local restaurant relationships, local marketing, local seeding
- This doesn't scale like a SaaS
- This scales like opening a restaurant in each city (hard)

❌ **You need to acquire guests**
- MV has ~50k seasonal visitors
- You need maybe 10-20% voting regularly
- How do you reach them? Tourists don't download apps for islands they're visiting
- Restaurant partnerships help, but that's 6-12 months away
- Until then, you're cold-acquiring through what channel?

❌ **Seasonal is a double-edged sword**
- Good: Compressed market, density
- Bad: Revenue is seasonal (3 months of data, 9 months of ghost town)
- Bad: Hard to justify salaries/costs with seasonal revenue
- Bad: Hard to build habits (users use the app 3 months/year)

**Verdict: 58/100** — You have a path, but it's not smooth. You'll hit the chicken-and-egg problem within 6 months. You'll need capital/sales team to break through. Geographic expansion will be slow and capital-intensive. This is a grind, not a rocket ship.

### 5. MONETIZATION POTENTIAL: 48/100

**Scenario 1: B2B (Restaurant subscriptions)**

Revenue model: Restaurants pay for analytics dashboard
- "Starter: $99/mo" → basic metrics
- "Pro: $299/mo" → advanced analytics + benchmarking
- "Enterprise: $1k+/mo" → API + dedicated support

Problems:
- ❌ Most restaurants have <$2M annual revenue
- ❌ They won't pay $300/mo for analytics they're skeptical about
- ❌ You need 100+ restaurants to hit $30k/mo (sustainable)
- ❌ Conversion will be <5% (most won't care)
- ❌ Churn will be high (they try it, see no ROI, cancel)

**Realistic revenue (best case):** $50-100k/year (MV only, 10-20 restaurants at $400/year average)

**Scenario 2: B2C (Guest premium)**

Revenue model: Guests pay for insights
- "Premium voter: $4.99/mo" → personalized recommendations, badges, saved favorites
- Affiliate links to restaurants for reservations

Problems:
- ❌ Guests have zero willingness to pay for voting
- ❌ There's no premium experience worth paying for
- ❌ Conversion will be <1%

**Realistic revenue:** Negligible ($0-10k/year)

**Scenario 3: Advertising/Sponsorships**

Problems:
- ❌ Too small to attract food brands
- ❌ Restaurants won't pay (they're your data source)
- ❌ Tourism boards? Maybe, but that's $5-20k/year

**Realistic revenue:** $0-20k/year

**Scenario 4: Acquisition (most likely)**

Problem:
- This looks like a great acquisition target for: DoorDash, Uber Eats, Toast, Resy
- They'd buy you for $2-10M (small)
- You'd get rolled into their platform
- Founders make money, business stops existing independently

**Verdict: 48/100** — Monetization is genuinely hard. B2B is the only path with real $ potential, but requires changing guest behavior + restaurant adoption. You might hit $100k/year on MV with herculean effort. Real exit is probably acquisition, not IPO.

---

## OVERALL DIAGNOSIS: 62/100

### Why 62, not 40 or 80?

**Bull case (why it could work):**
- ✅ Problem is real (people DO want better food data)
- ✅ Solution is elegant (yes/no voting is better than 5 stars)
- ✅ Execution is starting right (MV is defensible starting point)
- ✅ B2B angle is genuinely novel (restaurants want this data)
- ✅ Product quality is solid (you've built something clean)
- ✅ You could capture MV market in 12 months with focused effort
- ✅ A $5-10M acquisition is plausible in 2-3 years

**Bear case (why it might fail):**
- ❌ Cold start is brutal (chicken-and-egg)
- ❌ Guest acquisition is unclear (how do you reach tourists?)
- ❌ Restaurant adoption is uncertain (will they care?)
- ❌ Monetization is weak (neither B2B nor B2C is obvious)
- ❌ Expansion is capital-intensive (not a network effect business)
- ❌ Market size is small (MV alone can't sustain a company long-term)
- ❌ Incumbents can copy you (Google/Yelp/TikTok all have advantages)
- ❌ You need capital + team within 6 months (can't bootstrap this)

### Most likely outcomes:

| Probability | Outcome |
|-------------|---------|
| 60% | You grind on MV, hit moderate success ($50-200k/year), get acquired by Toast/Resy for $3-8M |
| 25% | You expand to 5-10 islands over 3 years, become sustainable indie, never venture-scale |
| 10% | You hit product-market fit with restaurants earlier than expected, scale to 50+ cities, $50M+ exit |
| 5% | Cold start kills you within 18 months, you pivot or shut down |

---

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO RIGHT NOW

**If you want to maximize upside:**

### 1. Prove guest adoption on MV (next 3 months)
- Get 1,000+ active voters
- Track: weekly active users, votes per user, retention
- If this works, restaurants will follow

### 2. Lock in 10 restaurant partnerships (months 3-6)
- Don't wait for perfect integration
- Start with "can you give our QR code to 5 guests this week?"
- Prove the loop works before building dashboards

### 3. Measure restaurant behavior change (months 6-9)
- Did any restaurants change their menu based on your data?
- Did they see value?
- This is your real product-market fit signal

### 4. Raise capital (if you haven't)
- You can't bootstrap to $100M
- But you can raise $500k-$1M on this deck
- Use it to hire: 1 salesperson, 1 engineer, expand to 2-3 islands

### 5. Have an exit thesis
- Don't expect $1B+ outcome
- Realistically, this gets acquired for $5-20M in 3-4 years
- That's a win, not a failure

## WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS 80/100

You'd need to move 3 critical metrics:

### 1. PROBLEM/SOLUTION FIT: 75 → 90

**Current issue:** It's a "nice to have," not a pain point.

**How to make it 90:**
Show that guests actively CHANGE their behavior based on your data.

**Metrics that prove this:**
- ✅ 50%+ of voters say "This data influenced my choice" (survey)
- ✅ Restaurant partners report "We got X% more traffic from your app"
- ✅ Repeat voters (2+ times per month) = habit forming
- ✅ Open rate on notifications >30%
- ✅ Guest testimonials like: "I tried [dish] because the ratings were high, and it was amazing"

**Action:** Build post-vote surveys. Ask: "Did this help you decide?" Track the % who say yes. If it's >40%, you've got problem-fit. If it's <20%, you have a problem.

### 2. MARKET SIZE & TIMING: 55 → 85

**Current issue:** MV alone is too small. Geographic expansion is uncertain.

**How to make it 85:**
Prove the model works on MV, then show it replicates to other destinations.

**Option A: Prove MV Revenue Potential**
- Get 20+ restaurants as paid partners (even if just $99/mo each)
- Show $2k/mo revenue from 15k-person island
- Extrapolate: "That's $16k/mo for 120k-person destination"

**Option B: Lock in Restaurant Partnerships Early**
- Get a quote: "This helped us cut our worst-performing dish and increase sales"
- This proves B2B viability, unlocks expansion timeline

**Option C: Prove Guest Habit Formation**
- 30%+ of voters use the app 2+ times in a month
- 50%+ of voters return within 30 days

### 3. DIFFERENTIATION: 72 → 85

**Current issue:** Defensibility is 2-3 years max. Incumbents can copy.

**How to make it 85:**
Build something competitors CAN'T easily copy: The Restaurant Data Network Effect.

**Strategy:** Get to 80%+ restaurant adoption on MV within 12 months

**Metrics that prove this:**
- ✅ 80%+ of MV restaurants using your QR code
- ✅ 50%+ of MV summer visitors voting on your app
- ✅ Restaurants report 10%+ of orders coming from your recommendations
- ✅ Zero restaurants asking to opt-out (they see value)

### 4. EXECUTION PATH: 58 → 85

**Current issue:** Chicken-and-egg, unclear guest acquisition, capital intensive expansion.

**How to make it 85:**
Prove the MV Playbook Works (Next 6 months)

Document exactly what you did to get 1,000+ active voters:
- Where did they come from?
- What hook worked?
- What retention looks like
- What drove restaurants to participate

### 5. MONETIZATION POTENTIAL: 48 → 85

**Current issue:** B2B is weak, B2C is nonexistent.

**Path A: Restaurant B2B SaaS (Most Likely)**

Get to $10k/mo from MV restaurants alone:
- Free tier (1 month): All restaurants get free basic dashboard
- Prove value in 30 days
- Charge $199/mo for "Optimization tier"

**Target:** 15-20 restaurants at $200/mo average = $3-4k/mo from MV alone

---

## THE SYNTHESIS: What 80/100 Looks Like

Hit these 6 milestones in the next 12 months:

| Milestone | Target | Why It Matters |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Guest adoption | 2,000+ monthly active voters on MV | Proves problem-fit |
| Restaurant adoption | 20+ paid partners (even at $99/mo) | Proves B2B viability |
| Revenue | $5k-10k/mo from MV | Proves monetization works |
| Retention | 40%+ monthly retention on guests | Proves it's a habit, not novelty |
| Customer testimonial | 1 restaurant: "Changed our menu based on data" | Proves restaurants see value |
| Expansion clarity | Documented playbook for next island | Proves scalability |

**If you hit 4 out of 6, you're at 75/100.**
**If you hit all 6, you're at 80/100+**
